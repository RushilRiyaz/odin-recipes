# odin-recipes

This is a recipe book written with HTML for "The Odin Project": https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

Goal of this assignment was to create a basic recipe book using HTML. I learnt how to use basic HTML commands, link pages and images to the website and practice using git and github.

After learning the basics of CSS I have used my new gained knowledge to add styling.
